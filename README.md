  <summary><b>More about me (or him)</b></summary>
<p align="left">  
<small> 
<hr />
Amine started working on the optimization of underwriting and risk modeling software for reinsurance companies (some of which were presented at the "Data + AI Summit") in Europe, the US and Asia. This background allowed him to work with multiple CSPs and Data solution providers such as Databricks, ICP4Data and Domino.
<br /><br />
Today, he works on the implementation of data platforms and the optimization of data pipelines / architectures.  He can work on different stages of a project: audit, architecture to implementation. The success of his missions relies on the transparent relationship he maintains with his client, his sense of service and the quality of communication with the different people and teams.
<br /><br />
He has helped clients optimize costs up to 10x on projects in production. He adopts a challenger's position and tries to integrate as well as possible to help the teams to understand and master the ins and outs of their projects.<br /><br />
The geek story started long before, Amine was passionate about computer science since childhood. He won many competitions local and international and hackathons.
