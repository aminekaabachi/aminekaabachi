<summary>A Little More About me!</summary>
<p align="left">  
<small> 
<hr />
In 2018, I completed a successful internship on software optimization to handle more data for the fourth global reinsurer present in 160 countries around the world. From there, I contributed to the optimization of on-premises and Azure ETL systems and pipelines, the implementation and architecture of data platforms and datalabs across multiple public clouds, and the migration of data processing workloads to Azure.
<br /><br />
My geek story started long before, I was passionate about computer science since childhood. I won many competitions local and international and hackathons and I'm still active on cybersecurity competitions with the CTF “the3000” team.
<br /><br />
I love to solve problems and find solutions and then work hard to make them optimal. I enjoy the Linux ecosystem. and i think kubernetes is the future of operating systems. I also like good presentations / tech-talks so I try to make slides that are artistically fair when I have the opportunity.
